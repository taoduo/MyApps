# My Personal Website
I have my youtube video here.

## Functional Description
It primarily serves as my toolbox containing all applications I built for my own use. It is a dynamic project, which means I will put it here whenever I think of something useful and doable. The cover page and the tech learning notebook is ready. Here is my general plan for the time being.
* Cover Page (finished)
* Tech Notebook (finished)
*  Online Interactive Resume (I also have a static resume at www.goldenduo.com) (Coming)
*  Scheduler and task manager: check my schedule, make appointment with me and keep track of what I need to do everyday
*  Do some data-crawling for me such as keep track of the lastest tech news.
*  Manage my accounts on all those websites. I often forget the password.
*  Some IoT projects, such as an application that makes a plot of my weight, which is directly uploaded from my scale when I use it.

## What I Used
I developed this website using expressjs and mongodb and some frontend libraries.
## Run the Notebook
To run the notebook, first set up mongodb (I have a database called test at the backend. For details of the database, please check note_model.js) and nodejs. Then just pull and start it on your localhost with
```
npm start
```
Thank you!
