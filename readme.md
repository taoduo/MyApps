# My Personal Website
## Functional Description
It primarily serves as my toolbox containing all applications I built for my own use. It is a dynamic project, which means I will put it here whenever I think of something useful and doable. The cover page and the tech learning notebook is ready. Here is my general plan for the time being.
1. Cover Page (finished)
2. Tech Notebook (finished)
3. Online Interactive Resume (I also have a static resume at www.goldenduo.com) (Coming)
4. Scheduler and task manager: check my schedule, make appointment with me and keep track of what I need to do everyday
5. Do some data-crawling for me such as keep track of the lastest tech news.
6. Manage my accounts on all those websites. I often forget the password.
7. Some IoT projects, such as an application that makes a plot of my weight, which is directly uploaded from my scale when I use it.

## What I Used
I developed this website using expressjs and mongodb and some frontend libraries.
## Run the Notebook
To run the notebook, first set up mongodb (I have a database called test at the backend. For details of the database, please check note_model.js) and nodejs. Then just pull and start it on your localhost with
```
npm start
```
Thank you!
