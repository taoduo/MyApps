# My Personal Website
# It primarily serves as my tech learning notebook.
# It also serves as my online scheduler.
# If possible, I will also show some of my projects on it.
# I developed this website uses bootstrap, jquery and tinyMCE on the frontend , expressjs and mongodb on the backend.
# To run it, after setting up mongodb and nodejs, you can just pull and start it on your localhost.
# Thank you!
