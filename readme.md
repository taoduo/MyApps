# My Personal Website
## Functional Description
It primarily serves as my tech learning notebook but may also have other purposes like online scheduler. If possible, I will also show some of my projects on it.
## What I Used
I developed this website uses bootstrap, jquery and tinyMCE on the frontend , expressjs and mongodb on the backend.
## How to Run
To run it, first set up mongodb and nodejs. Then just pull and start it on your localhost with
```
npm start
```
Thank you!
