# This is my personal website.
# It primarily serves as my tech learning notebook.
# It also serves as my online scheduler.
# If I have time I will show show some of my projects on it but that is not very important. If you are interested in this, please simply look through in my github.
# My website uses expressjs (jade template engine) and mongodb.
# To try it, just get your mongodb ready first(I have a database called test), pull it and run it.
